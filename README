4. Open application in xcode

Double click "Reseller.xcworkspace" in root directory of app (use finder)

5. Try to build the app, if there's an error, please see uploaded screenshot in repo (project_settings.png).
In order to get to that settings in the screenshot, click the top level of the project "Reseller" (with blue icon)

Make sure to fix all errors.

Here are some possible errors:

a. Error in Team
-> Make sure you choose Personal
b. Bundle identifier
-> rename com.lbarretto.hyprviscomatic to com.<your_preferred_name>.hyprviscomatic
c. Deployment Target should be 10.0 

6. If no errors already, connect your device to macbook and you should recognize your device when choosing target device.
Choose your actual device then build again


Hope this works! :)
P.S. Please bare with my code, first solo IOS app I developed. Wasn't able to optimiza due to time constraints. Cheers!
